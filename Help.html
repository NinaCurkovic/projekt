   <p style="text-align: justify;"> On the Zara.com page, you can purchase as a GUEST or as a REGISTERED customer.<br><br>

      Registration is very simple. We will only ask you for the information necessary
      to facilitate<br> the purchase process.<br><br>
      
      In the registration form, you will see examples of filling in that can help you<br> 
      enter some information, such as your phone number.<br>
      Order information will always be available to you in your account if you are a<br>
      registered customer or through a link that we will send you in an email confirming<br>
      your purchase if you are buying as a guest.</p>
